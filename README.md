# leetcode
A repository that contains all my work on LeetCode questions

What have I learnt:

Two Sum:

    You can use 'in range(len(array_name))' to iterate through an array
 
 Palindrome Number:
 
    You can use '[::-1]' to reverse a string
    
Longest Common Prefix:

    You can use '[1:]' to omit the first item in a list and display the rest
    
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:

    You can get infinity as 'float('inf')'
    
    You can get the minimum value using 'min' and the maximum value using 'max'
    
Reverse Integer:
    
    Modular division using '%'
    
    Integer division using '//'

Binary Search:

    For a binary search, the idea is to create left and right pointers and then find the midpoint of 
    the list, check to see if the target is left or right of it and then create a new midpoint and 
    continue the search
    
Two Sum II:

    For the two pointer technique, the idea is to create left and right pointers and then you can loop 
    through an array with ease
    
Reverse Words in a String II:

    When reversing words in a string, we can implement multiple pointers i.e. two pointers to reverse
    the whole string and then a fast and slow pointer to reverse each individual word
